## 💥 What Inspired Me to Build This

After successfully uploading my first ever project on GitHub, I woke up super motivated to keep the momentum going Inshallah! 🚀  
I searched online for a “form builder template” and found a nice layout that caught my eye. I thought:  
**“Wait! I can build this myself from scratch!”**  

And just like that  with some creativity, commitment, and research this  <strong> Volleyball Registration Form </strong>  was born!

It’s a mix of my **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** learning journey  and proof that hands-on, project-based learning is super fun and effective!
